# Problem Statement: You are planning a grocery shopping trip. You want to keep track of the items you need to buy. Initially, you only have a few items on your list, but as you remember more things, you want to add them to the list. Once you buy an item, you can remove it from the list.

# Tasks:

# Create a list that contains the initial items on your shopping list: ["Milk", "Bread", "Eggs"].
# Add the following items to the list: "Butter", "Cheese", and "Apples".
# After buying "Milk" and "Eggs", remove them from the list.
# Print the updated shopping list.


# my_list=["milk","rice","egg","cake"]

# my_list.append(["Butter", "Cheese", "Apples"])
# my_list.remove("milk")
# my_list.remove("egg")
# print(my_list)


# Tuple Creation &amp; Indexing
# Write a Python program to create a tuple containing the elements: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
# Print the second and fourth elements using indexing.


tuple=(10,20,30,40,50,60)
#for abc in tuple:
print(tuple[2]  and tuple[4])
